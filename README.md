A sister update has been released in the liverychanger plugin that adds a new A321 livery, feel free to use both plugins at the same time as they are cross-compatible.

Note, this is a pre release and is subject to change at any moment. Much of what is seen here is not a final product.

Old versions of this plugin are NOT COMPATIBLE with low-end devices. Those versions are reliant on a minimum refresh rate of 30 fps, as this is the refresh rate of the fly by wire system. For best results, use the latest revision.

**CHANGELOGS:**<br>
Version Pre-Release 1:<br>
  First Iteration of the plugin. Had severe FBW issues.
  
Version Pre Release 1.1:<br>
  Second Iteration, new FBW rules to make ground handling easier, minor rewrite of some of the FBW systems to prevent control fighting.
